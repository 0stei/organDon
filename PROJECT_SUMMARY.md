# Organ Donation Management System - Summary

## Project Summary

**OrgDon** is an Android application built using Java and Gradle, targeting Android API 33 with minimum support for API 21. The app leverages Firebase Realtime Database for cloud-based data storage and synchronization, with offline persistence enabled through a custom `OfflineFirebase` Application class. The application follows an Activity-based architecture with Material Design UI components, utilizing RecyclerView with FirebaseUI adapters for efficient real-time data binding. Key features include comprehensive donor management with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), allowing users to add new donors with information such as name, address, organ donated, age, blood group, phone number, and hospital. The app provides advanced filtering capabilities through dedicated activities for eight blood groups (A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, O-) and six organ types (Heart, Liver, Lungs, Kidneys, Pancreas, Small Bowel), enabling healthcare professionals to quickly locate compatible donors. Additionally, the Hospital List feature includes real-time search functionality to filter donors by hospital name. The app uses ViewBinding for type-safe view access, integrates Glide for image handling, and implements CardView layouts for an intuitive user interface. All donor data is stored in Firebase Realtime Database with automatic synchronization, and the app supports offline access with data persistence, making it reliable for use in various network conditions.
